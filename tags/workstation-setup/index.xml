      <description>Introduction Before Java 8 there was no need to have multiple JDKs on your machine. Java development process was slow enough that even big and rusty corporations could catch up. But since JDK 9 the development process is much faster and new Java versions are released more often.
Why even bother? Some projects may run on an older JDK due to various reasons:
 the tooling does not yet support new JDKs, some libraries do not work on new JDKs - this can be seen when migrating from pre-JDK 9 to JDK 9 or onward, sometimes it is better to wait than to be an early adopter for core production services, and many, many more.</description>
